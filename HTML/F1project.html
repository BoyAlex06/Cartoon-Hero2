    <p style="color:rgb(12, 204, 194);font-family:Arial-Black">The Mercedes W14 is a Formula One racing car designed and constructed by the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team competing in the 2023 Formula One World Championship1. The car was designed with a higher ride height with the aim to reduce porpoising.
     However, the car proved to be less competitive than expected at the start of the season, causing key figures in the Mercedes team to question the effectiveness of the car’s concept. The W14 features a striking black livery, used by Mercedes through 2020 and 2021 as part of its anti-racism messaging</p>

  <p style="color:rgb(255, 4, 4);font-family:Arial-Black;">The Ferrari SF-23 (also known by its internal name, Project 675) is a Formula One racing car designed and constructed by Scuderia Ferrari competing in the 2023 Formula One World Championship. 
    The car is driven by Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Jr. car was launched on 14 February 2023 and was revealed as SF-23 on 7 February 2023. The SF-23 shows a great resemblance to the F1-75 that preceded it, but in reality it is a car that should have corrected the errors that had made it weak from a certain point of the season onwards.
     The SF-23 is a considerable evolution of last year’s chassis. The SF-23 sidepods compared with F1-75’s the depressions in the sidepod top remain and there is no Red Bull-like cooling cannon in the bodywork sides, the hot air extraction taken care of by the extensive array of louvres</p>
